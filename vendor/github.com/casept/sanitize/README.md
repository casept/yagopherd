This is just a simple golang library for checking user-supplied paths for attempts to perform directory traversal. See the [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/casept/sanitize) for details.

You probably should read the code before using this for anything actually security-sensitive. It has tests, but I'm fairly unexperienced at this programming thing. Caveat emptor.
